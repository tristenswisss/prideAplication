# Real-time Synchronization Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan to verify that real-time synchronization is working correctly across all features of the Pride App, including messaging, live events, community posts, and notifications.

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Components
1. Two or more devices/emulators with the Pride App installed
2. Supabase project with the schema implemented
3. Network connection for all devices
4. Test user accounts with proper authentication

### Pre-test Configuration
1. Ensure all devices are connected to the same network
2. Verify Supabase real-time subscriptions are enabled for relevant tables
3. Confirm all users have proper permissions to access real-time data
4. Set up test data in the database for initial state verification

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Messaging Real-time Updates

#### Test Case 1.1: New Message Notification
**Objective**: Verify that when User A sends a message to User B, User B receives it in real-time.

**Steps**:
1. User A and User B open their respective chat applications
2. User A navigates to the conversation with User B
3. User A sends a new message
4. User B observes the message appearing in real-time without manual refresh

**Expected Results**:
- Message appears in User B's chat interface immediately
- Message timestamp is accurate
- Message content is correctly displayed
- Conversation list shows updated last message

#### Test Case 1.2: Message Status Updates
**Objective**: Verify that message delivery/read status updates in real-time.

**Steps**:
1. User A sends a message to User B
2. User B opens the conversation
3. Observe delivery and read status indicators update in real-time

**Expected Results**:
- Delivery status updates when message is received by User B's client
- Read status updates when User B opens the conversation
- Status indicators are synchronized between both users

### 2. Live Events Real-time Updates

#### Test Case 2.1: Viewer Count Synchronization
**Objective**: Verify that live event viewer counts update in real-time as users join/leave.

**Steps**:
1. User A starts a live event
2. User B and User C join the live event
3. Observe viewer count updates on all devices
4. User B leaves the event
5. Observe viewer count decreases on remaining devices

**Expected Results**:
- Viewer count increases when users join
- Viewer count decreases when users leave
- All devices show synchronized viewer counts
- Maximum viewer count is tracked correctly

#### Test Case 2.2: Live Chat Messages
**Objective**: Verify that live event chat messages appear in real-time for all participants.

**Steps**:
1. User A starts a live event
2. User B and User C join the event
3. Each user sends chat messages
4. Observe messages appearing in real-time for all participants

**Expected Results**:
- Messages from all users appear immediately for all participants
- Message timestamps are consistent
- User avatars and names are correctly displayed
- Message reactions appear in real-time

#### Test Case 2.3: Live Event Status Changes
**Objective**: Verify that live event status changes (start/end) are synchronized.

**Steps**:
1. User A creates a live event (not yet started)
2. User B views the event list
3. User A starts the live event
4. User B observes the event status change to "LIVE"
5. User A ends the live event
6. User B observes the event status change to "ENDED"

**Expected Results**:
- Event status updates immediately for all users
- UI elements reflect the current event status
- Join/Leave functionality is enabled/disabled appropriately

### 3. Community Feed Real-time Updates

#### Test Case 3.1: New Post Creation
**Objective**: Verify that new community posts appear in real-time for all users.

**Steps**:
1. User A, User B, and User C are viewing the community feed
2. User A creates a new post
3. Observe the post appearing at the top of the feed for User B and User C

**Expected Results**:
- New post appears immediately for all users viewing the feed
- Post content, images, and metadata are correctly displayed
- User avatars and names are accurate
- Timestamp is consistent across devices

#### Test Case 3.2: Post Interactions
**Objective**: Verify that post likes, comments, and shares update in real-time.

**Steps**:
1. User A creates a post
2. User B likes the post
3. User C comments on the post
4. User A observes the like and comment counts update in real-time

**Expected Results**:
- Like count increases immediately for all users
- Comment appears immediately in the comments section
- Comment count updates for all users
- UI reflects the current interaction state for each user

### 4. Notifications Real-time Updates

#### Test Case 4.1: Notification Delivery
**Objective**: Verify that notifications are delivered and displayed in real-time.

**Steps**:
1. User A performs an action that triggers a notification for User B (e.g., likes User B's post)
2. User B observes the notification appearing immediately

**Expected Results**:
- Notification appears immediately in User B's notification list
- Notification badge updates on the UI
- Notification content is accurate
- Timestamp is correct

#### Test Case 4.2: Notification Status Updates
**Objective**: Verify that notification read status updates in real-time.

**Steps**:
1. User A triggers a notification for User B
2. User B opens the notification
3. User A observes the notification read status update

**Expected Results**:
- Notification marked as read immediately
- UI reflects read status for both users
- Notification badge count updates appropriately

## Implementation Verification

### Supabase Real-time Subscriptions
Verify that the following tables have real-time subscriptions enabled:
- `messages` - For chat message synchronization
- `live_messages` - For live event chat synchronization
- `notifications` - For notification delivery
- `posts` - For community feed updates
- `comments` - For comment synchronization

### Error Handling
Test error scenarios to ensure graceful handling:
1. Network disconnection during real-time session
2. Supabase service interruption
3. Authentication token expiration
4. Large volume of simultaneous updates

## Performance Testing

### Latency Measurement
1. Measure time from action initiation to UI update across different network conditions
2. Verify updates occur within acceptable timeframes (target: < 500ms)

### Load Testing
1. Test with multiple concurrent users (target: 100+ simultaneous users)
2. Verify system stability under load
3. Monitor resource usage on client devices

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Setup
1. Create test users with known credentials
2. Pre-populate database with sample data for consistent testing
3. Set up test scenarios with predictable outcomes

### Test Data Cleanup
1. Implement automated cleanup of test data after each test run
2. Ensure test data doesn't interfere with production data
3. Reset database state between test sessions

## Monitoring and Logging

### Real-time Monitoring
1. Implement logging for real-time subscription events
2. Monitor connection status and reconnection attempts
3. Track message delivery success/failure rates

### Debugging Tools
1. Provide developer tools for inspecting real-time data flow
2. Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting
3. Create diagnostic views for subscription status

## Rollout Strategy

### Phased Deployment
1. Test with small group of internal users
2. Gradually expand to larger user base
3. Monitor performance and error rates during rollout

### Fallback Mechanisms
1. Implement fallback to polling if real-time subscriptions fail
2. Provide manual refresh options for users
3. Gracefully degrade functionality if real-time features are unavailable

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Real-time updates occur within 500ms of action completion
- 99% of real-time updates are successfully delivered
- UI correctly reflects current data state
- Error handling is graceful and informative

### Performance Requirements
- Memory usage remains stable during extended real-time sessions
- Battery consumption is minimized
- Network usage is optimized

### User Experience Requirements
- Real-time updates are seamless and unobtrusive
- Users are not overwhelmed by frequent updates
- UI remains responsive during real-time data updates

This testing plan ensures comprehensive verification of real-time synchronization features across all aspects of the Pride App.
